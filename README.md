## Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Single-input control system** - Accessibility through simplicity (because let's be honest, more buttons would just confuse things)
- ✅ **Real-time collision detection** - Accurately detects every one of your failures
- ✅ **Persistent high score tracking** - Immortalizes your best 10-second performance
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Play on any device, fail on all devices
- ✅ **Smooth 60 FPS animation** - Watch your tiger crash in stunning fluidity
- ✅ **Procedurally generated obstacles** - Infinite content, infinite suffering

### Technical Highlights
- Zero loading time
- Lightweight asset optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility
- State management (mostly managing your emotional state)

## Technical Stack

```
Frontend: HTML5 Canvas / React
Deployment: Vercel
Physics Engine: Custom gravity simulation (beta)
Difficulty Scaling: Exponential (and slightly sadistic)
```

## Gameplay

Guide a majestic tiger through an endless series of pipes by carefully timing your taps. Each successful passage awards one point. The current world record is held by someone with definitely too much free time.

**Objective:** Achieve a higher score than your previous attempt while maintaining your dignity.

**Average Session Duration:** 4.7 seconds (according to our analytics and your patience)

## Installation

### Quick Start

No installation required. Simply visit:
```
https://flappy-tiger.vercel.app/
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-tiger.git

# Navigate to directory
cd flappy-tiger

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Watch your productivity disappear
```

## Controls

| Action | Input |
|--------|-------|
| Flap/Jump | Click, Tap, or Spacebar |
| Start Game | Click, Tap, or Spacebar |
| Restart After Failure | Click, Tap, or Spacebar |
| Question Life Choices | Automatic |

**Note:** There is no pause button. This is a feature, not a bug.

## Game Mechanics

### Physics Model

The tiger operates under a simplified Newtonian physics model:

- **Upward Force:** 8 pixels/frame (when jumping)
- **Gravity:** 0.5 pixels/frame² (constant)
- **Terminal Velocity:** Yes (unfortunately)
- **Reality Compliance:** 0%

### Scoring System

```
Base Score: 1 point per pipe cleared
Bonus Points: None (we're not that generous)
Score Multiplier: 1x (forever)
```

### Difficulty Curve

The game maintains a consistent difficulty level, which is to say: consistently difficult. Pipes appear at randomized heights to ensure fair and equal opportunity for failure.

## Performance

**Metrics:**
- Average FPS: 60
- Memory Usage: ~15MB
- Battery Drain: Comparable to your hopes and dreams
- Rage Quit Rate: 73% within first minute

## Browser Support

| Browser | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome | ✅ Supported | Recommended |
| Firefox | ✅ Supported | Equally frustrating |
| Safari | ✅ Supported | Works flawlessly at ruining your day |
| Edge | ✅ Supported | Microsoft can't save you now |
| IE11 | ❌ Unsupported | Honestly, it's time to move on |

**Mobile:** Fully responsive on iOS and Android devices. Your commute just got more stressful.

**Native Android App:** For the full tiger-crashing-into-pipes experience, download our native Android app. Features include:
- Offline play (suffer anywhere, anytime)
- Native performance (fail faster)
- Home screen icon (constant reminder of your inadequacy)
- Push notifications (we don't actually send any, we're not that evil)

## Known Issues

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multiplayer mode (competitive suffering)
- [ ] Leaderboards (public humiliation feature)
- [ ] Sound effects (auditory frustration enhancement)

- [ ] Dark mode (for late-night rage sessions)

## FAQ

**Q: Why is this so hard?**  
A: The game mirrors life - difficult, unforgiving, but somehow you keep trying.

**Q: Is there an end?**  
A: Only when you accept defeat.

**Q: What's the highest score possible?**  
A: Theoretically infinite. Practically, you'll be happy with 10.

**Q: Can I use this for stress relief?**  
A: Absolutely not. This causes stress, not relieves it.
